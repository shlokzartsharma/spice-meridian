# Spice - AI Signal Detection for Brands

Spice is a full-stack TypeScript application that helps consumer brands understand how they're mentioned in AI-generated content across the web. Think of it as "Google Analytics for AI mentions" - tracking brand performance in the new AI-driven discovery landscape.

## üéØ The Problem & Solution

**The Problem**: Consumer brands are completely blind to how they're being recommended in AI responses.

**Real Example**:
- User asks ChatGPT: "What's the best project management tool?"
- ChatGPT responds: "I'd recommend Asana for teams, Monday.com for visual workflows, or Notion for all-in-one workspace..."
- **Asana has zero visibility this recommendation happened**
- **Monday.com doesn't know they were positioned as "visual"**
- **Notion doesn't know if being called "all-in-one" helps or hurts**

**What Spice Does**:
1. **Input**: Brands submit prompts they care about ("best project management tools")
2. **Search**: Uses web search to find AI-generated responses to these prompts
3. **Analyze**: Uses AI to extract brand mentions, sentiment, positioning, and competitive context
4. **Insights**: Shows brands their "AI visibility score" and how they compare to competitors

## üöÄ Features

- **AI Content Detection**: Automatically finds and analyzes AI-generated responses
- **Brand Intelligence**: Track mentions, sentiment, positioning, and competitive analysis
- **Real-time Dashboard**: Monitor your AI visibility score and brand performance

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"

# API Keys (for production)
BRAVE_API_KEY="your-brave-search-api-key"
OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"

# App Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

### Replacing Mock Services

The application currently uses mock data for demonstration. To use real services:

1. **Brave Search API**: Replace the mock search in `src/lib/search.ts`
2. **OpenAI API**: Replace the mock analysis in `src/lib/analysis.ts`

## üìà Sample Data

The application comes pre-loaded with realistic sample data including:

- **4 Market Research Prompts**: CRM, Authentication, Communication, Project Management
- **8 AI-Generated Responses**: From ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Bard
- **15+ Brand Mentions**: HubSpot, Salesforce, Auth0, Slack, Asana, etc.
- **Complete Analyses**: With rankings, sentiment, and insights

## üé® Design System

The application uses a clean, professional design system:

- **Colors**: Orange primary (#f97316), blue accents (#2563eb), gray scale
- **Typography**: Inter font family with clear hierarchy
- **Layout**: 260px sidebar, responsive grid system
- **Components**: Reusable UI components with consistent styling

## üîÑ API Endpoints

### Prompts
- `GET /api/prompts` - List all prompts
- `POST /api/prompts` - Create new prompt
- `GET /api/prompts/[id]` - Get specific prompt with analysis
